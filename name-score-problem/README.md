#NameScoreProblem

This app reads in from a text file full of comma delimitted names. It sorts them into alphabetical order and then writes them to the file. Then the total name score is printed out. A name score is calculated by summing the letters in each name (A - 1, B - 2, etc.) and multiplying them by the position the name is in the sorted list.

*Running the App*

* Clone this repository
* `cd` to the top level
* Run the following command:
    * `javac NameScoreCalculator.java`
    * `java NameScoreCalculator names.txt`
