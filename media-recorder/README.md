# Media Recorder

The purpose of this app is to allow users to record video from their webcams.

The index.html file needs to be run from a server in order to access the webcam content.
If you access the index.html file directly "file:///.../index.html", browsers will prevent
webcam content from being loaded. 

To run the app:
1. cd to the top level directory
2. Run the command "node static-server.js"
3. Open a web browser and go to localhost:9000/index.html
